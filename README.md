# SRT + EFPBonding example

This example uses EFP ([ElasticFramingProtocol](https://github.com/agilecontent/efp)) as a layer between the producer/consumer of data and the bonding layer. 

[EFPBonding](https://github.com/agilecontent/efpbond) plugin sits between EFP and the network layer.

As network protocol/transport layer SRT ([SecureReliableTransport](https://github.com/Haivision/srt)) is used.

An SRT C++ wrapper used by this example. The wrapper is located [here](https://github.com/andersc/cppSRTWrapper).
